When a target spawns, it will make a sound at its location, so you can hear where it spawns. You can move around freely during a game and the targets will spawn around you as you move.

The game supports up to 6 players, competing to be the first to complete 3 laps. 1 lap is all 3 stages of Ilios, looped together with teleporters.\\n\\nHow to play:\\nHold primary fire to accelerate forward, secondary fire to reverse. The A and D keys can be used to provide a small amount of strafing. After running over an item box (blue sphere), an icon will appear over your character telling you what item you have. Avoid red spheres which slow you down (unless you use a mushroom or starman) and hit speed boosts and jump pads and try to maintain your speed. If you get stuck in a red sphere, you’ll have to repeatedly click to get out. Item distribution is based on your position in the race, just like in Mario Kart.\\n\\nItem Icons:\\n·        Banana: Yellow Dizzy\\n·        Green Shell: Green Circle\\n·        Fake Block: Upside Down Question Mark\\n·        Red Shell: Red Circle\\n·        Mushroom: Red Up Arrow\\n·        Thundercloud: Red Lightning\\n·        Starman: Purple diamond (why don’t they have a star icon)\\n·        Ink: White dot\\n·        Golden Mushroom: Yellow Up Arrow\\n·        Pow Block: Blue Down Arrow\\n·        Lightning: Yellow Lighting\\n·        Bullet: Fire\\n·        Blue Shell: Blue Circle\\n\"}]}","sharecode":"WR2VM","type":"Game Mode","summary":"Mario Kart in Overwatch","hotness":233.1389888888889,"votes":[{"bnet_id":300990395,"vote":1,"time":{"$date":"2019-05-19T01:25:01.086Z"}},{"bnet_id":303309689,"vote":1,"time":{"$date":"2019-05-19T02:16:11.504Z"}},{"bnet_id":52313853,"vote":1,"time":{"$date":"2019-05-19T03:52:21.922Z"}},{"bnet_id":54371131,"vote":1,"time":{"$date":"2019-05-21T17:05:42.183Z"}},{"bnet_id":447006877,"vote":-1,"time":{"$date":"2019-06-02T09:54:23.592Z"}}],"last_update":{"$date":"2019-05-19T01:25:01.080Z"},"time":{"$date":"2019-05-19T01:25:01.080Z"},"__v":0}

If he does, the ally he has touched takes the bomb and has to touch another ally.\\n\\nJUNKRAT\\nUse your ability 2 (E) to put a trap which kills an enemy at 1 meter radius from it. You can put 2 traps at the same time. When an enemy is at 5 meters from a trap, an information is displayed on his screen and he can see its location.

The second ability, using right primary attack, creates a purple dome which grows up gradually for 10 seconds, and which makes every survivor in it walks to you. Both abilities use energy, but the dome needs 100% of it to be created and consumes all of it to its activation. You can use your ability 2 to teleport as you normally use.\\n\\nTRACER\\nUse your ability 1 (SHIFT) as you normally use (to blink).

You can also use your sleep dart as you use normally to send him back to his spawn.\\n\\nBAPTISTE\\nUse your ability 2 (E) to create a zone where everyone in there is invisible and healed. You can also use your jump (charge to jump higher) as you normally use.\\n\\nBRIGITTE\\nHold your shield up (right click) to take 50% less damage (you don't lose movement speed and you are 3 shotted instead of 2 shotted). Use your ability 2 (E) when you look at an ally and you are at 30 meters radius from him to give him the same ability as yours for 15 seconds.\\n\\nD.VA\\nUse your SHIFT key to run faster for a few seconds. After your first death, you wil be ressurected without losing any ressurection points. This happens once and after the first death only.\\n\\nDOOMFIST\\nDamage the hunter to stun him for 1 second and to heal yourself.\\n\\nGENJI\\nUse your ability 2 (E) to dash in one direction. You are invulnerable during the dash. You can use your climb ability and double jump as you normally use.\\n\\nHANZO\\nDamage the hunter to hack him and make him deal no damage for a few seconds. You can use your climb ability, sonar arrow and dash as you normally use.\\n\\nLUCIO\\nYou can ressurect allies faster than the other survivors (same ressurect mechanic) with full hp and heal them and yourself with your AOE heal as you normally do. You can wall ride for a few seconds.\\n\\nMCCREE\\nUse your ability 2 (E) to knock down the hunter as you normally use. If you are at a radius of more than 25 meters from the hunter, he can see you and you can see him. After taking three hits, you can dodge the fourth one (It is a passive ability and when it is activated, you can see blue sparkles on Mccree = you dodge the next hit).

However, you become visible when you are at a radius of 2,5 meters from a generator. You can heal yourself staying invisible and use your translocator as you normally use (but it is placed at your current location).\\n\\nTORBJÖRN\\nUse left primary fire (hammer) on a generator to raise its charge by 5%. You can use your turret as you normally use to spot the hunter's arrival.\\n\\nWIDOWMAKER\\nUse and hold left primary fire to see from hunter's point of view. You can use your grapple hook as you normally use. You can also use your mine as you normally use, which slows down the hunter when it is activated.\\n\\nWINSTON\\nDamage the hunter with your weapon to steal his movement speed.

It has support for all heroes and maps/modes, a directional impulse system based on the direction of damage taken, and some neat adaptive UI elements that took way to long to figure out. Extensive map support (all but 2) and support for all modes (with rule toggle).\\n\\n\\n\\nInstead of damage, players will take knockback after a certain threshold (called \\\"Destabilizing\\\" because workshop strings kinda stink right now). The higher your damage, the more directional knockback you will take (based on the direction the damage came from). If you are pushed off the map, flung into the sparkly clouds, or hit your max damage threshold you will be killed.\\n\\nHeroes are divided into roles, Tank, Damage, and Healer. Tanks take less knockback and have a higher destabilizing threshold before they are knocked around. Damage heroes destabilize lower than tanks, but not as low as healers. Healers destabilize the soonest and take a little more knockback but are able to heal their damage percentage by dealing damage to enemies.\\n\\nDestabilizing percentages are only visible if you have damaged the player in the last 4 secs. Bastion takes 5 destabilizing damage every 3 seconds he is in turret form to offset the mass damage he does. Wrecking Ball will de-couple his hook after 3 seconds of use to avoid indefinite cling. All of these and more are explained by the adaptive UI in-game, there should be clarity of information throughout your playtime without having to leave the game.
